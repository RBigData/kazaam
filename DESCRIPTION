Title: Tools for Tall Distributed Matrices
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Many data science problems reduce to operations on very tall,
    skinny matrices.  However, sometimes these matrices can be so tall that they
    are difficult to work with, or do not even fit into main memory.  One
    strategy to deal with such objects is to distribute their rows across
    several processors.  To this end, we offer a container for tall, skinny,
    distributed matrices ('shaqs') in the form of an 'S4' class.  We also
    provide many useful numerical methods for operating on these distributed
    objects.
